# Random-Advice-iOS_App
Creating a simple iOS app that displays a random advice to the screen whenever a user hits a button.

I wanted to learn how to create iOS apps using Swift and Xcode, so I wanted to start off with a very simple single-view application.

I signed up for TeamTreeHouse.com and followed their Beginner iOS Development track. After completing their "Build a Simple iPhone App with Swift" lesson I was inspired to create my own with an alteration.

For my app I am obtaining the data, which is a JSON, with the use of a REST API from adviceslip.com
http://api.adviceslip.com/

So whenever the user hits the button, a random advice from the adviceslip API will be displayed to the screen.

Also, Swift is known to be quite troublesome when trying to deal with JSON, so I am using SwiftyJSON.

But to use it, Alamofire was also quite helpful as well.

This page was really helpful for me to use Alamofire and SwiftyJSON.

With the project I also had my first exposure to CocoaPods, which is a very convenient and easy to use frameworks manager.

And finally a really nice website that helps with app icons.
